derpy's script loader: hello_world example

difficulty:
 this is a STARTER example, so it is extra simple to show you the basics

prerequisites:
 you should understand the basics of Lua

summary:
 this mod shows the text "Hello, world!" on the screen

files:
 config.txt: this file is in every "script collection" (a folder that you put in _derpy_script_loader/scripts), it determines what scripts run
 hello.lua: our main script where all our code is

challenges:
 1. stop and restart "hello_world" using the console (by typing "stop hello_world" or "start hello_world" into it)
 2. make "Bye!" show up instead of "Hello, world!"
 3. make it alternate between showing "Hello, world!" and "Bye!" every second
