derpy's script loader: spawn_bodyguard example

difficulty:
 this is a BEGINNER example, so comments are extra verbose to help you learn

prerequisites:
 you should understand the basics of Lua and know how to use the console
 to use the console, just hit ~ (or ` in some regions)

summary:
 this mod lets you summon a ped to guard you using /bodyguard
 you can specify the name of the ped after /bodyguard

files:
 config.txt: the config for the script collection
 bodyguard.lua: the main script (and only script)

challenges:
 1. make spawned bodyguards stronger (hint: use the GameSetPedStat function)
 2. make a command to delete *all* bodyguards
