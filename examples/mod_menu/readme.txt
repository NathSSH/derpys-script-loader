derpy's script loader: mod_menu example

difficulty:
 this is an EXPERT example, comments are less verbose and so they can focus on more complex concepts

prerequisites:
 you should be familiar with using Lua to make script mods
 you should also be really comfortable with using tables

summary:
 this mod lets you open up a menu with F5 (by default) and use the arrow keys to control it

files:
 config.txt: the config for the script collection
 menu.lua: the main script

challenges:
 1. add more menu options to do more things, like give weapons
 2. give the menu a title bar and navigation sounds
