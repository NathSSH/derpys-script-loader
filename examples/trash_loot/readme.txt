derpy's script loader: trash_loot example

difficulty:
 this is a BEGINNER example, so comments are extra verbose to help you learn

prerequisites:
 you should be familiar with using Lua, making script mods, and understand tables in Lua are passed by reference

summary:
 you can loot trash cans once a day for a random item, and the mod saves which cans have been looted each day

files:
 config.txt: the config for the script collection
 loot.lua: the main script

challenges:
 1. make a prompt to show that you are near a lootable trash can
 2. make a way to still hide in trash cans
