derpy's script server: version 8

about:
 this is the server version of derpy's script loader and runs scripts very similarly to the normal client version
 players can connect to this server to download client scripts and interact with server scripts using network functions

linux:
 the derpy_script_server file is the 32-bit executable for Linux (if using x86_64 on ubuntu, you may need lib32z1 and libc6-i386)
 server commands are not currently supported on the Linux version, so you may have to resort to using admin scripts from dss-extras

resources:
 see the server manual for more help setting up your server (http://bullyscripting.net/server.html)
 extra scripts for many basic systems are available on github (https://github.com/derpy54320/dss-extras)
